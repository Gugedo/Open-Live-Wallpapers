# Open Live Wallpaper

A lightweight and easy to use live wallpaper engine for macOS, optimized for modern versions (Sonoma and later).

This project is a **fork** of [wallpaper-player-mac](https://github.com/haren724/wallpaper-player-mac) by haren724.

## Why this fork?
The original application faced several issues on macOS Sonoma (14.6+), specifically regarding file access permissions and a bugged file picker. This version aims to:
- **Fix the File Picker Bug:** You can finally add your own `.mp4` or `.mov` files directly through the UI.
- **Enhanced Permissions:** Correct implementation of Security Scoped Bookmarks to ensure the app remembers your wallpaper after a reboot.
- **Streamlined UI:** Removed unnecessary components to create an easier experience.

## 🛠 Installation
1. Go to the "Not ready yet, sorry" page.
2. Download the `.dmg` or `.zip` file.
3. Drag the app into your **Applications** folder.
4. **Note:** Due to macOS security, you might need to go to `System Settings > Privacy & Security` and allow the app to run.

## 📖 How to use
1. Launch **Open Live Wallpaper**.
2. Click on the menu bar icon and select **"Add Wallpaper"**.
3. Select any video file from your Mac.
4. The wallpaper will start playing automatically.
